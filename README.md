# RentRelief - AI-Powered BC Rental Contract Analyzer

An intelligent contract analysis tool for BC university students to identify problematic clauses in rental agreements before signing.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google's Gemini AI for deep semantic understanding of rental contracts
- **BC Law Compliance**: Checks contracts against BC Residential Tenancy Act regulations
- **Smart Clause Detection**: Identifies illegal, unfair, and concerning contract terms
- **Risk Scoring**: Provides an overall risk assessment (0-100 scale)
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Offers specific advice based on flagged issues
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens in your browser (except AI API calls)

## What It Detects

### High-Risk Violations
- Excessive security deposits (>0.5 months rent)
- Non-refundable deposits
- Illegal eviction clauses
- Waived tenant rights
- Unrestricted landlord entry
- Tenant responsible for major repairs

### Medium-Risk Issues
- Excessive late fees
- Guest restrictions
- Improper rent increase terms
- Pet deposit violations

### Informational Clauses/Low-Risk Issues
- Standard notice periods
- Utility responsibilities
- Subletting policies
- Pet restrictions (in strata)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **PDF Processing**: PDF.js
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## How It Works

### Analysis Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads PDF or TXT rental contract
2. **Text Extraction**: PDF.js extracts text from the document
3. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI analyzes the contract using structured prompts
4. **Fallback**: If AI fails, falls back to keyword pattern matching
5. **Results**: Displays risk score, flagged clauses, and recommendations

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt that includes:
- BC Residential Tenancy Act knowledge base
- Specific instructions for clause identification
- JSON schema for structured responses
- Examples of legal violations

### Dual Analysis System

```typescript
// Primary: Gemini AI (semantic understanding)
try {
  const result = await analyzeContractWithGemini(text);
  return result; // AI-powered analysis
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback: Keyword matching (reliable backup)
  return analyzeContractWithKeywords(text);
}
```
